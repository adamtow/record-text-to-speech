### Adding Screen Recording to Control Center
Record Text to Speech works best when you can easily access Screen Recording from Control Center. If Screen Recording is not in your Control Center, perform the following steps to add it:

![Adding Screen Recording to Control Center](https://adamtow.github.io/record-text-to-speech/images/add-screen-recording-control-center.png)

1. From the iOS Home Screen, tap **Settings**.
2. Tap **Control Center**.
3. Tap **Customize Controls**.
4. Tap **+** next to Screen Recording.

To access Control Center, swipe up from the Home Button if your iOS device has a Home button. Otherwise, swipe down from the top-left of the screen, usually where the battery indicator is located. 

The Screen Recording Icon looks like a circle with a solid white filled circle in the middle.

![Options menu after recording](https://adamtow.github.io/record-text-to-speech/images/new-recording-3.png)

- **Play**: Play the audio recording.
- **Quick Look**: Display a Quick Look interface for the audio recording.

In the cases of Record Again, Save Audio, and Don't Save, Photos will prompt you to delete the Screen Recording that was recorded. Files are saved in the `iCloud Drive/Shortcuts/Record Text to Speech` folder, so you don't need the screen recording in Photos anymore.

<span id="framework"></span>
### App Framework
Record Text to Speech was developed using the [Shortcut App Framework](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1510) approach to developing application-like shortcuts. This framework was also used to develop:

- [**Cronios**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1267): The shortcuts scheduler for iOS.
- [**GeoCuts**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1732): Run shortcuts automatically based on your location.
- [**WatchCuts**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1864): Trigger shortcuts on your iPhone and iPad using any of your iCloud-connected devices: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or iCloud.com!
- [**LaunchCuts**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/959): Folders and tags for your organizing and launching your shortcuts.
- [**Inspector**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/1106): View and modify objects at runtime in your shortcuts.
